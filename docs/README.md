# Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a Tic Tac Toe game implemented in JavaScript. It allows a player to play against an AI opponent using the minimax algorithm to determine the optimal moves. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the goal is to get three of your symbols (either 'X' or 'O') in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Features

- Play against the AI: The game provides an AI opponent that uses the minimax algorithm to make intelligent moves.
- Visual feedback: The game board is displayed visually using HTML and CSS, with symbols ('X' and 'O') represented by images.
- Score tracking: The game keeps track of the score for both the player and the AI.
- Refresh functionality: There is a refresh button to reset the game board and start a new game.

## Learning Outcome

Through this project, you will gain experience and knowledge in the following areas:

- HTML: Understand and implement the structure of the game board using HTML elements.
- CSS: Apply styles and layouts to create an appealing and visually engaging game board.
- Responsiveness: Ensure that the game board adapts and displays properly on different devices and screen sizes.
- JavaScript: Use JavaScript to handle game logic, user interactions, and AI decision-making.
- DOM Manipulation: Manipulate the HTML document object model (DOM) to update the game board and display scores dynamically.
- Minimax Algorithm: Implement and apply the minimax algorithm to create an AI opponent that makes intelligent moves and provides a challenging gameplay experience.
